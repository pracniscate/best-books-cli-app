# BestBooks

Welcome to a Ruby gem that lists best novels of all time, as presented by the editors on Book Depository. You will be able to see the whole list of books and read the short summary of your chosen book.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'best_books'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install best_books

## Usage

To run the code, simply clone it from GitHub with `git clone`, change to the new directory with `cd`, and finally, type in `./bin/best-books` to start the application. You will then be prompted to input a yes or no question after which you will be able to view the numbered list. If you desire to read a summary, input the number of the book and you will be presented with it.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
